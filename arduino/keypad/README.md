# simple keypad project 
We used a 4x4 matrix membrane keypad, there are usually other configuration such as 3x4 or even 1x4 but in this simple project we decided to use the 4x4 keypad with the arduino.
## What you need 
1. Arduino uno
2. 4x4 keypad
3. 8 female to male jumper wires
4. Arduino IDE installed 
## Steps 
* Download and install Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

* connect the pins of the keypad as shown then run the code in your IDE
