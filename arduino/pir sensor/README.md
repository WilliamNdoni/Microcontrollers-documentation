## PASSIVE INFRARED SENSORS
- A PIR sensor detects infrared light radiating from objects in its environments.
- They are majorly used as motion sensors.
- When motion was detected the buzzer went on and the led was Lit.


### WHAT YOU NEED
1. Arduino uno
2. LED
3. PIR sensor
4. female to male jumper wires
5. male to male jumper wires
6. Arduino IDE installed
7. Breadboard
8. Buzzer
9. 1 kilo ohm resister


- The PIR sensor does not require specific libraries and can work well with the libraries that are already in the Arduino IDE.

### STEPS
1. Download the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Connect the circuit as shown in the schematics
