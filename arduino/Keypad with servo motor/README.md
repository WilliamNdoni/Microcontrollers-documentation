# simple locking mechanism

We used a 4x4 keypad to move a servo motor 90 degrees

## What you need

1. Arduino uno
2. 4x4 keypad
3. female to male jumper wires
4. male to male jumper wires
5. micro servo motor
6. LCD 16x2
7. 1 LED
8. 1 2k resistor
9. Arduino IDE installed

## Steps

- Download and install Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Download keypad library from within the arduino IDE. Navigate to Sketch > Include library > manage libraries and search for keypad, make sure it is the one written by Mark stanley
- connect the circuit as shown [here](connection/Keypadlock.png)
